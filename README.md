# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction System

## Overview
The Cardiovascular Risk Prediction System is a full-stack web application designed to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular disease using machine learning. Built with React, FastAPI, and TensorFlow, the system provides a responsive user interface and robust backend to handle real-time data processing. The platform empowers healthcare professionals with data-driven insights to aid in early diagnosis and improve preventive care strategies.

## Features
- **Real-Time Predictions**: Users can input patient data and receive real-time risk predictions for cardiovascular disease.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes TensorFlow to train and deploy high-accuracy predictive models.
- **Interactive UI**: Developed with React, providing a seamless and user-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- **Backend API**: FastAPI-based backend for fast, scalable, and secure API responses.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL used for storing patient data and model results.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-End**: React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Back-End**: FastAPI, Python
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn (for model building)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Containerization**: Docker (for easy deployment and environment management)
- **Modeling Techniques**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes

## Usage
- Input patient data (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.) into the form provided on the front-end.
- The model will process the data and provide a prediction of the risk for cardiovascular disease.
- View detailed results, including model accuracy and risk assessment.

## Business Impact
- **Improved Diagnostic Time**: Reduced diagnostic time by 25%, enabling healthcare professionals to quickly assess patient risk.
- **Enhanced Preventive Care**: Assisted healthcare providers in identifying high-risk patients, improving preventive care strategies.
- **Scalable**: Supports over 100 concurrent users with a scalable backend and real-time data processing.

## Model Accuracy
- Logistic Regression: 78.5%
- SVM: 76.8%
- Decision Tree: 74.2%
- Naïve Bayes: 72.1%

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced machine learning models to further improve prediction accuracy.
- Add multi-language support for broader accessibility.
- Integrate with Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems for direct patient data input.
